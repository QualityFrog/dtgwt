## Example App
Now, suppose you have a simple app with one form and two buttons.

![ezgif.com-gif-maker.gif](https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/1817/dafff458-cd1f-4dab-9802-152242474407.gif)


- The number "0" is entered as the initial value.
- When the "+" button is clicked, the number is incremented.
- When the "-" button is clicked, the number is decremented.
- The minimum value of the number is "0".
- The maximum value of the number is 255.
- If a non-numeric character is entered, the message "Invalit value" will be displayed.

## Decision table
You have written the following decision table (or something like it) to test this app.

|          |                              |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |               |               |
|--------- | ---------------------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ------------- | ------------- |

|          | Initial input is "255"       |     |     |     |     |     |     | Y   | Y   |               |               |
|Action    |                              |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |               |               |
|          | Click "+"                    | Y   |     | Y   |     | Y   |     | Y   |     |               |               |
|          | Click "-"                    |     | Y   |     | Y   |     | Y   |     | Y   |               |               |
|          | Modify Initial input to "AB" |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     | Y             |               |
|          | Modify Initial input to "1%" |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |               | Y             |
|Result    |                              |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |               |               |
|          | Input                        | 1   | 0   | 2   | 1   | 255 | 253 | 255 | 254 | 0             | 0             |
|          | Error Message                | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | Invalid Input | Invalid Input |

# Problem happened 
However, your test management tool only accept to import scenario-based format as shown below.
you needs to be converted to the following format

|Scenario No|Test conditions|Step description|Step expected result|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|Given Initial input is "0"|When Click "+"|Then Input:1 and Error Message:N/A|
|2|Given Initial input is "0"|When Click "-"|Then Input:0 and Error Message:N/A|
|3|Given Initial input is "1"|When Click "+"|Then Input:2 and Error Message:N/A|
|4|Given Initial input is "1"|When Click "-"|Then Input:1 and Error Message:N/A|
|5|Given Initial input is "254"|When Click "+"|Then Input:255 and Error Message:N/A|
|6|Given Initial input is "254"|When Click "-"|Then Input:253 and Error Message:N/A|
|7|Given Initial input is "255"|When Click "+"|Then Input:255 and Error Message:N/A|
|8|Given Initial input is "255"|When Click "-"|Then Input:254 and Error Message:N/A|',
|9|Given Initial input is "0"|When Modify Initial input to "AB"|Then Input:0 and Error Message:Invalid Input|
|10|Given Initial input is "0"|When Modify Initial input to "1%"|Then Input:0 and Error Message:Invalid Input|

The only way to do this is to create a new tab in the xlsx containing the decision table and convert it one by one by your hands.

It should make you annoying right?

# Solution
I have created a simple web application to solve the above problem.

![ezgif.com-gif-maker (2).gif](https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/1817/83740374-2f20-a984-f193-40164c090c3d.gif)

~~The input is also in markdown, which is really not very user-friendly (lol).~~
~~I'll make a tool that converts xlsx to markdown to solve this problem later on.~~
(Solved 2022 Feb 13th have a look [here](#how-to-use))
 
 You can find the [source code](https://github.com/freddiefujiwara/dtgwt) here
The demo application is
[here](https://freddiefujiwara.com/dtgwt/#inputscript)

I made this in about two hours in  mess.
